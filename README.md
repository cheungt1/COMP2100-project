# Go Fish
## Description
### What?
A Go Fish online game that supports up to four players, with a minimum of 2. 
### Why?
This idea helps promotes the use of passing objects through a network to interact with not just a server, for holding all the cards and information, it also allows clients to interact between each other to play a simple game of Go Fish. It allows the team to get more exposure to using socket programming, passing objects through networks and multi-threading.
### How?
By using Java, we will create two objects, Card and Player, that will keep track of the cards that are in play and in the stack. Using JavaFX, a basic GUI will be made to allow each player to interact with each other.
## Deliverables
1. A graphical representation of Go Fish 
2. Functioning game of Go Fish with Client-Server implementation
3. Documentation
